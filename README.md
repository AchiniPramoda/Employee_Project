Employee  Application


Technologies
I have used MERN stack for create almost all of the functionalities of this application. To create frontend I use React JS and for backend I used Node JS with Express. To store data I used MongoDB

File structure
When I create this application I created seperate folders for implement the frontend and the backend. 


npm install


Do same for frontend folder. This will inatall all the dependency packages into the project. Then navigate to the backend folder and run

npm run dev


And the application will run on the port 3000 in your browser.
